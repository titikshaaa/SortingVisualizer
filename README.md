# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

The goal of the project is to graphically visualize sorting algorithms. The application sorts a randomly generated array in the ascending order, where each sorting step is visualized.

Available settings for the user:

- Size of the array
- Time of one animation step (speed)
- Type of sorting algorithm

In this project, we do not directly modify DOM elements. Before starting the animation, a collection of steps is generated containing every array state. Updating the changes to be made is left to React.

## Available Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort

## Built With

- ReactJS
